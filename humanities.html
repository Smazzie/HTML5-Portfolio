                <div style="margin-left: 40px;">When I was a young man of 22 in Taiwan in 1972 trying to become fluent and literate in Chinese, I was faced with the prospect of learning to write about 5000 characters and 60,000 character combinations. The characters were complex with many strokes and almost no apparent logic. I found on the rare occasions when I could get a step by step evolution of the character from its original form, with an explanation of its original meaning and an interpretation of its original form, suddenly it would become apparent how all the strokes had come to be. The problem is that there is no book in English that adequately explains this etymology and even if you read Chinese there is no single book in Chinese that explains it all. In short it is a research project to understand each character. To have this information at my fingertips in English would have been a great help.</div>

                <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The <em>Historical Thesaurus of English</em> is a unique resource charting the semantic development of the huge and varied vocabulary of English. It is the first historical thesaurus ever produced for any language, containing almost every word in English from Old English to the present day. Of major interest to historians, philologists, linguists, and the general reader, the <em>Thesaurus</em> is an unrivalled resource for the historical study of the language. It is based on a comprehensive analysis of English as found in the second edition of the <em><a class="semigentle" href="http://www.oed.com/" target="_blank">Oxford English Dictionary</a></em> (<em>OED</em>) and <em><a class="semigentle" href="http://oldenglishthesaurus.arts.gla.ac.uk/" target="_blank">A Thesaurus of Old English</a></em> (for words restricted to the Old English period of c.700-1150 AD). All these words and their dates of recorded use are displayed within a detailed semantic <a class="semigentle" href="http://historicalthesaurus.arts.gla.ac.uk/classification/">framework</a>, offering a fascinating picture of the development of the vocabulary of English from its origins in Anglo-Saxon times to the present.</div>

All entries and substantive updates are refereed by the members of a distinguished <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/board.html">Editorial Board</a> before they are made public. Consequently, our dynamic reference work maintains academic standards while evolving and adapting in response to new research. You can cite fixed editions that are created on a quarterly basis and stored in our <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/">Archives</a> (every entry contains a link to its complete archival history, identifying the fixed edition the reader should cite). The <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/contents.html">Table of Contents</a> lists entries that are published or assigned.

                <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Through the generous support of the Polonsky Foundation, this project will make 1.5 million digitized pages freely available over the next three years. Portions of the Bodleian and Vatican Libraries&rsquo; collections of Hebrew manuscripts, Greek manuscripts, and incunabula have been selected for digitization by a team of scholars and curators from around the world.&nbsp;The selection process has been informed by a balance of scholarly and practical concerns; conservation staff at the&nbsp;Bodleian and Vatican Libraries have worked with curators to assess not only the significance of the content, but the physical condition of the items, prioritizing items that are robust enough to withstand being transported to the imaging studio and handled by the photographers. In order to preserve the integrity and completeness of the manuscript collections, the libraries have also agreed to digitize whole collections where&nbsp;appropriate. The complete list of works to be digitized&nbsp;can be accessed <strong><a class="ui-link" href="http://bav.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/items-to-be-digitized-greek-manuscripts">here</a></strong> for Greek manuscripts, <strong><a class="ui-link" href="http://bav.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/items-to-be-digitized-hebrew-manuscripts">here</a></strong> for Hebrew manuscripts, and <strong><a class="ui-link" href="http://bav.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/items-to-be-digitized-early-printed-books">here</a></strong> for incunabula.

                <p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 40px;">The photographs in the Farm Security Administration - Office of War Information Photograph Collection form an extensive pictorial record of American life between 1935 and 1944. This U.S. government photography project was headed for most of its existence by Roy E. Stryker, who guided the effort in a succession of government agencies: the Resettlement Administration (1935-1937), the Farm Security Administration (1937-1942), and the Office of War Information (1942-1944). The collection also includes photographs acquired from other governmental and non-governmental sources, including the News Bureau at the Offices of Emergency Management (OEM), various branches of the military, and industrial corporations.</p>
                <p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 40px;">In total, the black-and-white portion of the collection consists of about 175,000 black-and-white film negatives, encompassing both negatives that were printed for FSA-OWI use and those that were not printed at the time. To view the unprinted negatives, go to the description for any FSA/OWI image and select the &ldquo;Browse neighboring items by call number&rdquo; link. Most unprinted negatives simply have &ldquo;Untitled&rdquo; as their caption. Some have titles based on similar images that appear to have related content. Color transparencies also made by the FSA/OWI are available in a separate section of the catalog: FSA/OWI Color Photographs [<a href="http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/fsac/about.html" style="text-decoration: none;">view description</a>].</p>

                  <br /> A fascinating mixture of the arts and social sciences, specifically focused on May Day/Labor History in Canada.</p>
                <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The members of&nbsp;the Graphic History Collective came together specifically to produce a historical account of May Day in Canada in the form of a comic book. For that purpose we received funding from the &ldquo;Working Histories&rdquo; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada&rsquo;s Research Knowledge Cluster initiated by Joan Sangster at Trent university, Peterborough,&nbsp;Ontario. Through our historical research we found many different May Day stories in newspapers, books, and journals, and drafted plans for combining text with images with the aim of making this history educational and inspirational for a cross-section of audiences. Over time new people joined our project, adding their own skills and talents, while sharing a love of history alongside a dedication to issues of social and economic justice. The Graphic History Collective continues to develop graphic history projects to present historical information about issues that remain important and relevant today. Members so far have included Mark Leier, Robin Folvik, Sean Carleton, Julia Smith, Sam Bradd, and Trevor McKilligan.</div>
